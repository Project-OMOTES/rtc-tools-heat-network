    """
    The cold demand component is there to add thermal power (Heat) out of the network. Typically,
    this component is used to model aggregated demands.

    The heat to discharge constraints are set in the HeatPhysicsMixin. We enforce that the outgoing
    temperature of the demand matches the absolute thermal power, Q * cp * rho * T_ret == Heat,
    similar as with the sources. This allows us to guarantee that the flow can always carry the
    heat and that thermal losses are always estimated conservatively, as the heat losses further
    downstream in the network are over-estimated with T_ret where in reality this temperature
    drops. It also implicitly assumes that the temperature drops in the network are small and thus
    satisfy minimum temperature requirements.
