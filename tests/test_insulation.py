class TestInsulation(TestCase):
    """
    This testcase class should contain the following tests:
    1. Test to select the lowest heating demands (best insulation level), check that the
     resulting demands are the same as the original demand (input file) * insulation factor for the
     best insulation level and that the source is sufficient for the demands
    1b. Similar to test 1, test to select the lowest heating demand for HeatingDemand_e6b3 (has 3
     possible insulation levels), and only specify 1 insulation level (which must be active) for
     HeatingDemand_f15e
    2. Test where only demand can be fulfilled by production if at least one Heatingdemand
     is insulated to reduce heating demand to below production capacity, but for other reasons
     should not insulate (reality this would be a case where the costs of insulation are
     relatively high thus insulation that is not cost efficient --> thus keeping high deltaT)(e.g.
     test with minimise pipe diameter, or minimize flow at sources)
    2b. Test as 2, but instead of not having enough production capacity in total, not having
     enough production capacity at standard network temperatures, such that network temperature of
     one hydraulically decoupled network should be reduced by insulation houses and thus reducing
     Tmin at those demands, such that lower network temperature can be chosen (again with minimize
     flow at sources) (e.g. still not cost efficient to insulate otherwise)
    3. Test to select LT sources (which have lower cost, but only possible if Tmin of demands is
     low enough)
    4. Test in which not all LT sources are selected as Tmin of demands is not low enough
     --> maybe 3 and 4 can be combined --> so forinstance only LT source behind HEX is selected due
     to insulation of that Heating demand, but other HD can not be insulated far enough for LT
     source on the primary network.(e.g. goal, minimise heat loss, does not solve the provided
     cases)
    5. Test where TCO minimised, combination of investment cost of insulation vs lower Temperature
     network, thus lower heat loss (and allowing cheaper LT producers).
    #TODO: add test cases 2, 2b, 3, 4 and 5 as detailed above
    #TODO: maybe we can make COP heatpump dependent on the chosen network temperatures
